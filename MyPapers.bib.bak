<p>Cutaneous leishmaniasis, a parasitic skin infection transmitted by the bite of a sand fly, can result in chronic skin sores and is estimated to affect more than 1.5 million persons worldwide. While the infection generally heals on its own in months to years, treatment can be expensive and difficult. We compared a heat treatment using the ThermoMed device to an (abbreviated) ten day course of intravenous Pentostam (a pentavalent antimony drug) in a population of U.S. soldiers who acquired their infections in Iraq. We found no statistically significant difference between the two treatments in the healing rate at two months. The heat treatment had less associated toxicity. Heat therapy is a ruggedized, battery operated method that could be adapted to humanitarian situations and less developed health care settings, likely with less cost and side effects than local treatment alternatives.</p>

Experiments were conducted on the Escherichia coli bacteria covering a topographically non-uniform agar surface acting as one of the DBD electrodes. They reveal that the nanosecond-pulsed DBD can inactivate bacteria in recessed areas whereas the microsecond-pulsed and conventional DBDs fail to do so. Charged species (electrons and ions) appear to play the major role in the bacteria inactivation with the nanosecond-pulsed DBD. Moreover, the nanosecond-pulsed DBD kills bacteria significantly faster than its microsecond-pulsed counterpart.},
  comment =  {Paper comparing nanosecond and microsecond pulsed DBDs using patterned (not flat) agar. Nanosecond was shown to be more uniform and ignited evenly over the whole agar plate, whereas microsecond plasma was filamentary and only ignited at points of the agar. E. Coli was used and nanosecond plasma was found to be more efficient at killing E. Coli, including on patterned agar. With an air flow parallel to the agar surface, the killing area was not increased suggesting that it is species that are in the plasma in direct contact with the bacteria that mediate the killing, including charged particles. Interesting bit about the importance of rise time and why it needs to be fast for the discharge to be uniform.},

  abstract = {Abstract The development of cold atmospheric pressure plasma sources was the starting point for the innovative field of plasma medicine many years ago. Today, a large body of information is available on the biomedical and clinical applications of plasma. Among the latter, wound healing is of special interest as there have been promising studies demonstrating a benefit of plasma in the treatment of chronic wounds. Wound healing is tightly regulated by redox mechanisms. This creates an exciting opportunity as we and others have identified reactive oxygen and nitrogen species to be the central components mediating biological effects of cold plasma. A directed delivery of the plasma-generated species to cells and tissues may therefore commence new therapeutic options not only in the healing of pathological wounds but also related to other redox-based diseases. The literature covers numerous findings on the biological effects of cold physical plasma sources. However, plasma sources strongly differ from each other making it challenging to summarize or even compare results from different types of sources from a physical and biological point of view. The aim of this comprehensive review is to provide a unique compendium of studies assessing the pre-clinical and clinical relevance as well as potential health risks related to the exposure to the atmospheric pressure argon plasma jet kINPen. This well-investigated and promising plasma source demonstrates a strong potential to be of clinical significance in the near future. Also, the collection of studies investigating its biological effects may serve as a role model for similar plasma sources and applications in the field of plasma medicine. },

  abstract = {Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) belongs to the reactive oxygen species (ROS), known as oxidants that can react with various cellular targets thereby causing cell damage or even cell death. On the other hand, recent work has demonstrated that \{H2O2\} also functions as a signalling molecule controlling different essential processes in plants and mammals. Because of these opposing functions the cellular level of \{H2O2\} is likely to be subjected to tight regulation via processes involved in production, distribution and removal. Substantial progress has been made exploring the formation and scavenging of H2O2, whereas little is known about how this signal molecule is transported from its site of origin to the place of action or detoxification. From work in yeast and bacteria it is clear that the diffusion of \{H2O2\} across membranes is limited. We have now obtained direct evidence that selected aquaporin homologues from plants and mammals have the capacity to channel \{H2O2\} across membranes. The main focus of this review is (i) to summarize the most recent evidence for a signalling role of \{H2O2\} in various pathways in plants and mammals and (ii) to discuss the relevance of specific transport of H2O2. },

In this paper we present absolute OH density measurements by broadband UV absorption in diffuse atmospheric-pressure RF glow discharges in mixtures of He and H 2 O. The use of a 310 nm light-emitting diode as a light source and a very high resolution spectrometer (2.6 pm resolution) made the estimation of the total OH density possible by simultaneously measuring the absorption rates of different spectrally resolved rotational lines of the OH( A – X ) transition. For different RF powers and water concentrations, OH densities and gas temperatures ranging between 6 × 10 19 and 4 × 10 20 m −3 and 345 and 410 K, respectively, were obtained. The gas temperature T g was also measured by three different methods. T g deduced from the rotational temperature of N 2 ( C – B ) emission, nitrogen being present as a trace impurity, provided the most reliable value. The rotational temperature T r of the ground state OH( X ) presented values with a maximum deviation of 25 K compared with T g . To obtain the gas temperature from the emission intensities of OH( A – X ) rotational lines, the recorded intensities of different lines must be corrected for the effect of self-absorption inside the plasma.},

Recently, it was reported that hydroxyl radicals (·OH), resulting from ozone decomposition, play a significant role in microbial inactivation when Bacillus subtilis endospores were used as the test microorganisms in pH controlled distilled water. However, it is not yet known how natural organic matter (NOM), which is ubiquitous in sources of drinking water, affects this process of disinfection by ozone-initiated radical reactions. Two types of water matrix were considered for this study. One is water containing humic acid, which is commercially available. The other is water from the Han River. This study reported that hydroxyl radicals, initiated by the ozone chain reaction, were significantly effective at B. subtilis endospore inactivation in water containing NOM, as well as in pH-controlled distilled water. The type of NOM and the pH have a considerable effect on the percentage of disinfection by hydroxyl radicals, which ranged from 20 to 50%. In addition, the theoretical C̅T value of hydroxyl radicals for 2-log B. subtilis removal was estimated to be about 2.4 × 104 times smaller than that of ozone, assuming that there is no synergistic activity between ozone and hydroxyl radicals.},

  abstract = {The biocidal action of the TiO2 photocatalyst has been now well recognized from massive experimental evidences, which demonstrates that the photocatalytic disinfection process could be technically feasible. However, the understanding on the photochemical mechanism of the biocidal action largely remains unclear. In particular, the identity of main acting photooxidants and their roles in the mechanism of killing microorganisms is under active investigation. It is generally accepted that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and \{OH\} radicals play the role. The aim of this study is to determine how the \{OH\} radical, acting either independently or in collaboration with other ROS, is quantitatively related to the inactivation of E. coli. The steady-state concentrations of \{OH\} radicals ([•OH]ss) in UV-illuminated TiO2 suspensions could be quantified from the measured photocatalytic degradation rates of p-chlorobenzoic acid (a probe compound) and its literature bimolecular rate constant with \{OH\} radicals. The results demonstrated an excellent linear correlation between [•OH]ss and the rates of E. coli inactivation, which indicates that the \{OH\} radical is the primary oxidant species responsible for inactivating E. coli in the UV/TiO2 process. The \{CT\} value of \{OH\} radical for achieving 2 log E. coli inactivation was initially found to be 0.8×10−5 mg min/l, as predicted by the delayed Chick–Watson model. Although the primary role of \{OH\} radicals in photocatalytic disinfection processes has been frequently assumed, this is the first quantitative demonstration that the concentration of \{OH\} radicals and the biocidal activity is linearly correlated. },

  abstract = {Burns are one of the most common and devastating forms of trauma. Patients with serious thermal injury require immediate specialized care in order to minimize morbidity and mortality. Significant thermal injuries induce a state of immunosuppression that predisposes burn patients to infectious complications. A current summary of the classifications of burn wound infections, including their diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, is given. Early excision of the eschar has substantially decreased the incidence of invasive burn wound infection and secondary sepsis, but most deaths in severely burn-injured patients are still due to burn wound sepsis or complications due to inhalation injury. Burn patients are also at risk for developing sepsis secondary to pneumonia, catheter-related infections, and suppurative thrombophlebitis. The introduction of silver-impregnated devices (e.g., central lines and Foley urinary catheters) may reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections due to prolonged placement of these devices. Improved outcomes for severely burned patients have been attributed to medical advances in fluid resuscitation, nutritional support, pulmonary and burn wound care, and infection control practices.},

  abstract = {Endogenous and exogenous sources cause oxidatively induced \{DNA\} damage in living organisms by a variety of mechanisms. The resulting \{DNA\} lesions are mutagenic and, unless repaired, lead to a variety of mutations and consequently to genetic instability, which is a hallmark of cancer. Oxidatively induced \{DNA\} damage is repaired in living cells by different pathways that involve a large number of proteins. Unrepaired and accumulated \{DNA\} lesions may lead to disease processes including carcinogenesis. Mutations also occur in \{DNA\} repair genes, destabilizing the \{DNA\} repair system. A majority of cancer cell lines have somatic mutations in their \{DNA\} repair genes. In addition, polymorphisms in these genes constitute a risk factor for cancer. In general, defects in \{DNA\} repair are associated with cancer. Numerous \{DNA\} repair enzymes exist that possess different, but sometimes overlapping substrate specificities for removal of oxidatively induced \{DNA\} lesions. In addition to the role of \{DNA\} repair in carcinogenesis, recent evidence suggests that some types of tumors possess increased \{DNA\} repair capacity that may lead to therapy resistance. \{DNA\} repair pathways are drug targets to develop \{DNA\} repair inhibitors to increase the efficacy of cancer therapy. Oxidatively induced \{DNA\} lesions and \{DNA\} repair proteins may serve as potential biomarkers for early detection, cancer risk assessment, prognosis and for monitoring therapy. Taken together, a large body of accumulated evidence suggests that oxidatively induced \{DNA\} damage and its repair are important factors in the development of human cancers. Thus this field deserves more research to contribute to the development of cancer biomarkers, \{DNA\} repair inhibitors and treatment approaches to better understand and fight cancer. },

In spite of their use, the mechanisms for achieving these properties are unclear. In this regard, we report on a computational investigation of the gas phase and surface kinetics during humid-air corona treatment of polypropylene (PP) and the resulting modification of its surface properties while varying energy deposition, relative humidity (RH), web speed, and gas temperature. Using results from a global plasma chemistry model validated against experiments, we found that increasing energy deposition increased the densities of alcohol, carbonyl, acid, and peroxy radicals on the PP surface. In doing so, significant amounts of gas phase O 3 and N x O y are produced. Increasing the RH increased the production of peroxy and acid groups, while decreasing those of alcohol and carbonyl groups. Production of O 3 decreased while that of HNO 3 increased. Increasing the temperature decreased the concentrations of alcohol, carbonyl, and acid groups on PP while those of the peroxy radicals increased. For a given energy deposition, higher web speeds resulted in decreased concentrations of alcohols, peroxy radicals, carbonyl, and acid groups on PP.},

  abstract = {Plasma in the sense of ionized gas can be referred to as the fourth state of matter following solids, liquids, and gases in view of their energy content. Application of high voltages across small gas filled spaces results in ionization of the air. Generally, two types of cold plasma can be discerned: direct plasma (e.g. dielectric barrier dischargeâDBD) and indirect plasma (plasma torch, plasma jet). In indirect plasma treatment, the plasma is produced in a remote cavity and ejected by gas flow onto the skin in the form of an effluent. In direct plasma treatment, the skin itself acts as the counter electrode. Advantageous features of direct plasma treatment include the higher plasma density as well as the induced high frequency electric current onto the skin. In plasma treatment antiinflammatory, antipruritic, antimicrobial, tissue stimulation, stimulation of microcirculation, and other therapeutic effects are achieved in a single treatment due to the combined action of ultraviolet radiation, reactive oxygen species (e.g. ozone), reactive nitrogen species, and electric fields. In line with other reports, we have already demonstrated the use of direct plasma treatment in skin disinfection, in atopic eczema (superinfected dermatitis), in modulating the epidermal barrier, as well as in chronic wound treatment. We as well as others did not notice any side effects of plasma treatment so far. In summary, cold atmospheric pressure plasma constitutes a new and innovative treatment option especially for superinfected skin diseases. These promising relatively new clinical applications warrant further carefully conducted translational research to delineate the modes of actions of plasma as well as potential long term side effects. This should lead to norms for the technical devices to allow a standardized treatment of given diseases in the mid-term. },

Novel aspects include the primacy of inflammatory processes, within the CNS, which leads to increased formation of âproinflammatoryâ cytokines that lead to increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mediation of the upregulation of genes that produce toxic products such as reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Here I utilize important background reports and synthesize ideas to help account for the noted increases in \{ROS\} and \{RNS\} and their biological reaction products in neurodegenerative diseases. The uniqueness of the \{CNS\} inflammatory processes include minimal damping of amplification processes, such as proinflammatory cytokine-mediated cascades, combined with unique genetic defects, that act in combination with other risk factors to repeatedly âsparkâ the inflammatory cascades to account for some of the major differences in neurodegenerative diseases. This hypothesis can be experimentally examined by development of definitive methods to quantitate unique products that are formed by processes predicted to occur under neurodegenerative conditions. },

The existing evidence on the evaluation of health-related quality of life for patients suffering from this condition is reviewed. Research evidence was categorized into qualitative research; development and validation of disease-specific tools; cross sectional quantitative methods; and longitudinal and outcomes studies. Major themes associated with leg ulceration include ulcer pain, poor sleep quality, mobility deficit and the resulting consequences on the patientsâ social lives. Patients frequently adapt their lifestyles to avoid situations that may lead to further ulceration. While elderly women experience the poorest quality of life, it appears that leg ulceration has the greatest impact on young men. Greatest improvements over time are achieved for patients whose ulcers heal completely. Leg ulceration has a major impact on patientsâ health-related quality of life. Studies must consider this as an important outcome, particularly when complete healing is unlikely. },

We propose a method of direct treatment of living tissue that occurs at room temperature and pressure without visible or microscopic tissue damage. The presented Floating-Electrode Dielectric Barrier Discharge plasma is proven electrically safe to human subjects and our results show no gross (visual) or histological (microscopic) damage to skin samples in minutes, complete tissue sterilization from skin flora in seconds, and blood clot formation in seconds of electric plasma treatment. We also observe significant hastening of blood clot formation via electric plasma induced catalysis of ``natural'' processes occurring in human blood. A model describing these processes is offered.},

Targeted and perhaps selective destruction of cancerous tissue is desirable for many reasons, ranging from the enhancement of or aid to current medical methods to problems currently lacking a solution, i.e., lung cancer. Demonstrated in this publication is the inactivation (killing) of human Melanoma skin cancer cell lines, inÂ vitro, by Floating Electrode Dielectric Barrier Discharge (FE-DBD) plasma. Not only are these cells shown to be killed immediately by high doses of plasma treatment, but low doses are shown to promote apoptotic behavior as detected by TUNEL staining and subsequent flow cytometry. It is shown that plasma acts on the cells directly and not by ``poisoning'' the solution surrounding the cells, even through a layer of such solution. Potential mechanisms of interaction of plasma with cells are discussed and further steps are proposed to develop an understanding of such systems.},

  abstract = {A zero-dimensional, semi-empirical model is used to describe the plasma chemistry in an argon plasma jet flowing into humid air, mimicking the experimental conditions of a setup from the Eindhoven University of Technology. The model provides species density profiles as a function of the position in the plasma jet device and effluent. A reaction chemistry set for an argon/humid air mixture is developed, which considers 84 different species and 1880 reactions. Additionally, we present a reduced chemistry set, useful for higher level computational models. Calculated species density profiles along the plasma jet are shown and the chemical pathways are explained in detail. It is demonstrated that chemically reactive H, N, O and OH radicals are formed in large quantities after the nozzle exit and H 2 , O 2 ( 1 Î g ), O 3 , H 2 O 2 , NO 2 , N 2 O, HNO 2 and HNO 3 are predominantly formed as âlong livingâ species. The simulations show that water clustering of positive ions is very important under these conditions. The influence of vibrational excitation on the calculated electron temperature is studied. Finally, the effect of varying gas temperature, flow speed, power density and air humidity on the chemistry is investigated.},

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the closely related reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are often generated in applications of atmospheric pressure plasmas intended for biomedical purposes. These species are also central players in what is sometimes referred to as âredoxâ or oxidationâreduction biology. Oxidationâreduction biochemistry is fundamental to all of aerobic biology. ROS and RNS are perhaps best known as disease-associated agents, implicated in diabetes, cancer, heart and lung disease, autoimmune disease and a host of other maladies including ageing and various infectious diseases. These species are also known to play active roles in the immune systems of both animals and plants and are key signalling molecules, among many other important roles. Indeed, the latest research has shown that ROS/RNS play a much more complex and nuanced role in health and ageing than previously thought. Some of the most potentially profound therapeutic roles played by ROS and RNS in various medical interventions have emerged only in the last several years. Recent research suggests that ROS/RNS are significant and perhaps even central actors in the actions of antimicrobial and anti-parasite drugs, cancer therapies, wound healing therapies and therapies involving the cardiovascular system. Understanding the ways ROS/RNS act in established therapies may help guide future efforts in exploiting novel plasma medical therapies. The importance of ROS and RNS to plant biology has been relatively little appreciated in the plasma biomedicine community, but these species are just as important in plants. It appears that there are opportunities for useful applications of plasmas in this area as well.},

  abstract = {The membrane integrity of a cell is a well-accepted criterion for characterizing viable (active or inactive) cells and distinguishing them from damaged and membrane-compromised cells. This information is of major importance in studies of the function of microbial assemblages in natural environments, in order to assign bulk activities measured by various methods to the very active cells that are effectively responsible for the observations. To achieve this task for bacteria in freshwater and marine waters, we propose a nucleic acid double-staining assay based on analytical flow cytometry, which allows us to distinguish viable from damaged and membrane-compromised bacteria and to sort out noise and detritus. This method is derived from the work of S. Barbesti et al. (Cytometry 40:214–218, 2000) which was conducted on cultured bacteria. The principle of this approach is to use simultaneously a permeant (SYBR Green; Molecular Probes) and an impermeant (propidium iodide) probe and to take advantage of the energy transfer which occurs between them when both probes are staining nucleic acids. A full quenching of the permeant probe fluorescence by the impermeant probe will point to cells with a compromised membrane, a partial quenching will indicate cells with a slightly damaged membrane, and a lack of quenching will characterize intact membrane cells identified as viable. In the present study, this approach has been adapted to bacteria in freshwater and marine waters of the Mediterranean region. It is fast and easy to use and shows that a large fraction of bacteria with low DNA content can be composed of viable cells. Admittedly, limitations stem from the unknown behavior of unidentified species present in natural environments which may depart from the established permeability properties with respect to the fluorescing dyes.},

The model is based on the self-consistent solutions to the Boltzmann equation coupled to the rate balance equations for the vibrationally excited molecules N 2 (X 1 Sigma g + ,v) and O 2 (X 3 Sigma g - ,v'), NO(X 2 Pi r ) molecules and N( 4 S) and O( 3 P) atoms. It is shown that the vibrational distribution of N 2 (X,v) plays a central role in the whole problem, affecting considerably the predicted concentrations of NO molecules and N atoms, whereas the concentration of O atoms is practically independent of both vibrational distributions. In particular, it is shown that, in the case of a rate coefficient of about 10 -13 cm 3 s -1 for the reaction N 2 (X,v)+O to NO+N, the N 2 (X,v) molecules are strongly de-excited by vibrational-translational energy exchange processes associated with N 2 -N collisions. In contrast, in the case of a higher value for this rate coefficient, the N 2 (X,v) molecules are efficiently destroyed by this mechanism. The contributions of the different processes to the total production of NO, N and O are evaluated and compared.},

  abstract =  {Non-thermal atmospheric-pressure plasma, also named cold plasma, is defined as a partly ionized gas. Therefore, it cannot be
equated with plasma from blood; it is not biological in nature. Non-thermal atmospheric-pressure plasma is a new innovative approach
in medicine not only for the treatment of wounds, but with a wide-range of other applications, as e.g. topical treatment
of other skin diseases with microbial involvement or treatment of cancer diseases. This review emphasizes plasma effects on
wound healing. Non-thermal atmospheric-pressure plasma can support wound healing by its antiseptic effects, by stimulation of
proliferation and migration of wound relating skin cells, by activation or inhibition of integrin receptors on the cell surface or by its
pro-angiogenic effect. We summarize the effects of plasma on eukaryotic cells, especially on keratinocytes in terms of viability,
proliferation, DNA, adhesion molecules and angiogenesis together with the role of reactive oxygen species and other components
of plasma. The outcome of first clinical trials regarding wound healing is pointed out.},

This open retrospective study evaluated effects on wound healing in vivo using the MicroPlaSter alpha device, with wound healing a secondary endpoint. Chronic wounds of various etiologies in 70 patients (Group A) were treated with plasma for 3â7 min. Wound dimensions before and after treatment were compared for plasma-treated and control wounds. Subgroup analyses were performed for all chronic venous ulcers (n=27, Group B) and 5 min plasma treatment of chronic venous ulcers (n=18, Group C). Patient acted as own control. In Group A plasma-treated wounds showed a greater reduction in width and length than control wounds. Reduction rates were non-significant. In Group B a significantly greater reduction in width was measured in plasma-treated ulcers compared to controls, but not in ulcer length. Group C showed again a significant reduction in width with plasma treatment but not in ulcer length. This study suggests that wound healing may be accelerated, particularly for chronic venous ulcers. },

After teething problems different non-thermal plasma technologies were developed and used in different clinical trials in patients possessing chronic and acute wounds, diverse skin and itching diseases. The results from these trials and the preceding in vitro and ex vivo experiments opened up new fields of applications, which one had not thought of before. More than 5 years of clinical experience so far demonstrated that this plasma technology could be applied in a safe and effective setting to human beings.

  abstract = {Background Bacterial contamination of surfaces with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a serious problem in the hospital environment and is responsible for significant nosocomial infections. The pathogenic contaminants form biofilms, which are difficult to treat with routine biocides. Thus, a continuous search for novel disinfection methods is essential for effective infection control measures. This demonstration of a novel technique for the control of virulent pathogens in planktonic form as well as in established biofilms may provide a progressive alternative to standard methodology. Methods We evaluated a novel technique of normal atmospheric nonthermal plasma known as floating-electrode dielectric-barrier discharge (FE-DBD) plasma against a control of planktonic and biofilm forms of Escherichia coli, S aureus, multidrug-resistant methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) -95 (clinical isolate), -USA300, and -USA400, using widely accepted techniques such as colony count assay, LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability assay, and \{XTT\} (2,3-Bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) assay. Results Exposure of free living planktonic forms of E coli, S aureus, and \{MRSA\} were rapidly inactivated by \{DBD\} plasma. Approximately 107 bacterial cells were completely (100%) killed, whereas 108 and 109 were reduced by approximately 90% to 95% and 40% to 45%, respectively, in less than 60 seconds (7.8 J/cm2) and completely disinfected in â€120 seconds. In established biofilms, the susceptibility of \{MRSA\} \{USA400\} was comparable with \{USA300\} but less susceptible than \{MRSA95\} (clinical isolate), S aureus, and E coli (P &lt; .05) to FE-DBD plasma, and plasma was able to kill \{MRSA\} more than 60% within 15 seconds (1.95 J/cm2). The killing responses were plasma exposure-time dependent, and cell density dependent. The plasma was able disinfect surfaces in a less than 120 seconds. Conclusion Application of \{DBD\} plasma can be a valuable decontamination technique for the removal of planktonic and biofilm-embedded bacteria such as \{MRSA\} -USA 300, -USA 400, methicillin-sensitive S aureus (MSSA), and E coli, the more common hospital contaminants. Of interest, E coli was more resistant than S aureus phenotypes. },

  abstract = {Oxidative stress leads to membrane lipid peroxidation, which yields products causing variable degrees of detrimental oxidative modifications in cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the key regulators in this process and induce lipid peroxidation in Escherichia coli. Application of nonthermal (cold) plasma is increasingly used for inactivation of surface contaminants. Recently, we reported a successful application of nonthermal plasma, using a floating-electrode dielectric-barrier discharge (FE-DBD) technique for rapid inactivation of bacterial contaminants in normal atmospheric air (S. G. Joshi et al., Am. J. Infect. Control 38:293-301, 2010). In the present report, we demonstrate that FE-DBD plasma-mediated inactivation involves membrane lipid peroxidation in E. coli. Dose-dependent ROS, such as singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide-like species generated during plasma-induced oxidative stress, were responsible for membrane lipid peroxidation, and ROS scavengers, such as α-tocopherol (vitamin E), were able to significantly inhibit the extent of lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage. These findings indicate that this is a major mechanism involved in FE-DBD plasma-mediated inactivation of bacteria.},

It was assumed that when used for wound cleansing, disinfection and the reduction of inflammation, AM would be safe and effective. Method: Between May 2008 and May 2009, ambulant patients presenting at one of four wound healing centres were included in the study. Patients had critically colonised and/or infected, malodorous wounds, covered with slough/fibrin or wounds showing inflammation of the periwound skin. Wounds were assessed in terms of percentage changes in fibrin, slough and granulation tissue, they were assessed clinically and high resolution digital photographs were scored by a physician who was blinded to treatment allocation. Results were compared at baseline (week 0) and following 42 days of AM treatment (week 6). Results: Seventy-three patients were included in the analysis. Dressing changes were at 2-day intervals on average, and the median treatment period was 46.04 days (range: 3â197). At 42 days, 33\% (n=24) of included wounds had healed, 57\% (n=42) had improved and 10\% (n=7) remained stagnant. Cleansing and wound disinfection with AM was effective. In 31 patients (42\%) wounds had showed clinical signs and symptoms of critical colonisation and/or infection at day 0, whereas at day 42 the infection was completely eradicated. Inflammation was reduced in 60\% (n=44) of cases and patients did not report pain or discomfort when using AM. Conclusion: The use of singlet oxygen was shown to be safe and the results of this study indicate AM to be useful for wound cleansing, disinfection, reducing inflammation and promoting wound healing. Confict of interest: The centres were supplied with the study product by the sponsor. The authors have no financial interest in writing this article. },

In this context, the hydroxyl OH radical density inside the biosolutions has been also investigated experimentally by ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy when the Ar non-thermal plasma jet has been bombarded onto them. It is found that the emission and absorption profiles for the other reactive oxygen species such as NO (226 nm) and O2*− (245 nm) are shown to be very small inside the biosolution in comparison with those for the OH radical species. It is found that the densities of OH radical species inside the biosolutions are higher than those on the surface in this experiment. The densities of the OH radical species inside the deionized water, Dulbecco's modified eagle medium, and phosphate buffered saline are measured to be about 2.1 {\texttimes} 1016, 1.1 {\texttimes} 1016, and 1.0 {\texttimes} 1016 cm−3, respectively, at 2 mm downstream from the surface under optimized Ar gas flow of 200 sccm. It is also found that the critical hydroxyl OH radical density for the lung cancer H460 cells to experience an apoptosis is observed to be around 0.3 {\texttimes} 1016 cm−3 under 1 min plasma exposure in this experiment.},

  abstract = {A self-consistent kinetic model is used to study the possibility of tuning the plasma composition in the afterglow of a flowing surface-wave microwave discharge by the different discharge and system parameters in the case of 90%Ar-10%(N 2 âO 2 ) and N 2 âO 2 mixtures. The afterglow system consists of a 0.5âcm diameter quartz tube of 50âcm in lengthâwhere the discharge is generated and the early-afterglow developsâand an afterglow reactor. The plasma composition is studied at the end of the discharge plasma column and at the reactor inlet as a function of the N 2 :O 2 ratio for selected conditions, which are set with the system parameters and are illustrated in the experimental set-up. The validity of the model used is proven by the agreement of the calculated atomic densities with those measured by mass spectrometry. Due to the pressure drop along the tube, the position of the discharge (which also defines the lengths of the early-afterglow, t aft ) and the discharge pressure ( p dis ) can be set with the position of the wave couplerâsurfatronâalong the tube at a constant gas flow rate (which defines the pressure in the reactor, p reac ). It is shown that the relative densities of species at the end of plasma column, which constitute the initial condition for the afterglow, depend on the discharge pressure. Therefore, at a constant gas flow rate with the position of the surfatron the plasma composition in the reactor is changing due to the variation of both the p dis and t aft . The evolution of the plasma composition is also studied when both the surfatronâs position and the gas flow rate are changed, realizing conditions (i) with the same p dis , and different t aft and p reac , and (ii) with the same t aft , and different p dis and p reac . Comparing the N 2 âO 2 binary and the ternary mixtures, it is shown that the atomic densities obtained in the binary mixtures can be reproduced in ternary mixtures with different N 2 :O 2 ratios. Furthermore, according to the spectra measured in the afterglow reactor, comparable UV radiation can be achieved in both ternary and binary mixtures with the same O 2 content.},

The antiseptic efficacy in vitro on porcine skin and in vivo on human skin was compared to that of octenidine. \{TTP\} could significantly reduce the bacterial load in comparison to untreated skin. However, the slightly reduced antiseptic properties of \{TTP\} are attributed to the current parameter set-up and technical limitations. },

The plasma exposure, while being lethal to both bacterial classes, also produced gross structural damage in the Gram-negative E.Â coli while none was observed in the more structurally robust Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis . An electrophysical process involving the role of the electrostatic tension on a charged body in a plasma is invoked to explain both observations. Since the efficacy of this electrophysical process depends not only on the tensile strength of the bacterial cell wall but also on its shape and texture, the need for more experimental studies, using a wide range of bacteria belonging to various morphological groups, is suggested. Ways to further test the validity of this electrophysical lysis mechanism for Gram-negative bacteria on one hand, and also to extend its operation to the more robust Gram-positive bacteria on the other, are suggested.},

A number of studies have shown that air plasmas are capable of inactivating a wide range of microorganisms in the matter of few seconds to few minutes. However, until now little information regarding quantitative measurements of the various plasma agents that can potentially participate in the inactivation process has been published. In this paper, emission spectroscopy and gas detection are used to evaluate important plasma inactivation factors such as \{UV\} radiation and reactive species. Our measurements show that for non-equilibrium, atmospheric pressure air plasmas, it is the oxygen-based and nitrogen-based reactive species that play the most important role in the inactivation process. },

Parallel performance of simulating helium \{DBD\} solved by the different degrees of overlapping of additive Schwarz method (ASM) preconditioned generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) for different modeling equations is investigated for a small and a large test problem, respectively, employing up to 128 processors. For the large test problem, almost linear speedup can be obtained by using up to 128 processors. Finally, a large-scale realistic two-dimensional \{DBD\} problem is employed to demonstrate the capability of the developed fluid modeling code for simulating the low-temperature plasma with complex chemical reactions. },

  abstract =  {<p>Non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma (NTAPP) is an ionized gas at room temperature and has potential as a new apoptosis-promoting cancer therapy that acts by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, it is imperative to determine its selectivity and standardize the components and composition of NTAPP. Here, we designed an NTAPP-generating apparatus combined with a He gas feeding system and demonstrated its high selectivity toward p53-mutated cancer cells. We first determined the proper conditions for NTAPP exposure to selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells. The apoptotic effect of NTAPP was greater for p53-mutated cancer cells; artificial p53 expression in p53-negative HT29 cells decreased the pro-apoptotic effect of NTAPP. We also examined extra- and intracellular ROS levels in NTAPP-treated cells to deduce the mechanism of NTAPP action. While NTAPP-mediated increases in extracellular nitric oxide (NO) did not affect cell viability, intracellular ROS increased under NTAPP exposure and induced apoptotic cell death. This effect was dose-dependently reduced following treatment with ROS scavengers. NTAPP induced apoptosis even in doxorubicin-resistant cancer cell lines, demonstrating the feasibility of NTAPP as a potent cancer therapy. Collectively, these results strongly support the potential of NTAPP as a selective anticancer treatment, especially for p53-mutated cancer cells.</p>},

  abstract = {Abstract PumpKin is a software package to find all principal pathways, i.e.Â the dominant reaction sequences, in chemical reaction systems. Although many tools are available to integrate numerically arbitrarily complex chemical reaction systems, few tools exist in order to analyze the results and interpret them in relatively simple terms. In particular, due to the large disparity in the lifetimes of the interacting components, it is often useful to group reactions into pathways that recycle the fastest species. This allows a researcher to focus on the slow chemical dynamics, eliminating the shortest timescales. Based on the algorithm described by Lehmann (2004), PumpKin automates the process of finding such pathways, allowing the user to analyze complex kinetics and to understand the consumption and production of a certain species of interest. We designed PumpKin with an emphasis on plasma chemical systems but it can also be applied to atmospheric modeling and to industrial applications such as plasma medicine and plasma-assisted combustion.

  abstract = {In the global perspective of antibiotic resistance, it is urgent to find potent topical antibiotics for the use in human and animal infection. Healing of equine wounds, particularly in the limbs, is difficult due to hydrostatic factors and exposure to environmental contaminants, which can lead to heavy bio-burden/biofilm formation and sometimes to infection. Therefore, antibiotics are often prescribed. Recent studies have shown that honeybee-specific lactic acid bacteria (LAB), involved in honey production, and inhibit human wound pathogens. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the effects on the healing of hard-to-heal equine wounds after treatment with these LAB symbionts viable in a heather honey formulation. For this, we included ten horses with wound duration of >1Â year, investigated the wound microbiota, and treated wounds with the novel honeybee LAB formulation. We identified the microbiota using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and DNA sequencing. In addition, the antimicrobial properties of the honeybee LAB formulation were tested against all wound isolates in vitro. Our results indicate a diverse wound microbiota including fifty-three bacterial species that showed 90Â {\%} colonization by at least one species of Staphylococcus. Treatment with the formulation promoted wound healing in all cases already after the first application and the wounds were either completely healed (nÂ =Â 3) in less than 20Â days or healing was in progress. Furthermore, the honeybee LAB formulation inhibited all pathogens when tested in vitro. Consequently, this new treatment option presents as a powerful candidate for the topical treatment of hard-to-heal wounds in horses.},

The former are responsible for the emission of UV photons associated with the NOÎ² bands. The NO(B) concentration is found to pass through a maximum, at approximately 1â3% of O 2 added to the mixture, which is in good agreement with the measured maximum of UV emission intensity, and with the shortest time required for the inactivation of spores. For such an O 2 percentage, the NO(B) also remains in the afterglow, with only a small reduction, up to a few ~100âms. Furthermore, the NO(B) concentration peaks with increasing pressure, with the corresponding maximum shifted to lower O 2 percentages, in agreement with the observations of UV intensity.

  abstract = {Research on low-temperature atmospheric plasma sources (LTAPS) has grown strongly over the last few years, in part driven by possible medical ' inÂ vivo ' applications. LTAPS offer new technology for medicine and biomedical engineering. Important application examples include in situ production of reactive molecules and ions, delivery at the molecular level, contact-free and self-sterilizing devices. An important issue is the efficient bactericidal effect of LTAPS, which has already been studied widely in vitro . In spite of the many investigations, details of the plasma effect on bacteria are still largely unknown. To contribute to a better understanding of the sterilization process, we investigated the morphological changes of bacteria using atomic force microscopy before and after plasma treatment at high resolution. We examined both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria at different plasma exposure times. Additionally, the effect of UV radiation as one agent in the plasma was investigated separately. Our results suggest that several sterilizing mechanisms exist and they proceed at different timescales.},

  abstract = {Absorption spectroscopy (AS) represents a reliable method for the characterization of cold atmospheric pressure plasma jets. The method’s simplicity stands out in comparison to competing diagnostic techniques. AS is an in situ , non-invasive technique giving absolute densities, free of calibration procedures, which other diagnostics, such as laser-induced fluorescence or optical emission spectroscopy, have to rely on. Ground state densities can be determined without the knowledge of the influence of collisional quenching. Therefore, absolute densities determined by absorption spectroscopy can be taken as calibration for other methods. In this paper, fundamentals of absorption spectroscopy are presented as an entrance to the topic. In the second part of the manuscript, a review of AS performed on cold atmospheric pressure plasma jets, as they are used e.g. in the field of plasma medicine, is presented. The focus is set on special techniques overcoming not only the drawback of spectrally overlapping absorbing species, but also the line-of-sight densities that AS usually provides or the necessity of sufficiently long absorption lengths. Where references are not available for measurements on cold atmospheric pressure plasma jets, other plasma sources including low-pressure plasmas are taken as an example to give suggestions for possible approaches. The final part is a table summarizing examples of absorption spectroscopic measurements on cold atmospheric pressure plasma jets. With this, the paper provides a ‘best practice’ guideline and gives a compendium of works by groups performing absorption spectroscopy on cold atmospheric pressure plasma jets.},

It is an economical and an ecological technology for water treatment due to its generation at atmospheric pressure and low discharge voltage. Microplasma electrodes were placed at small distance above the water thus active species and radicals were flown by the gas towards the water surface and furthermore reacted with the target to be decomposed. Indigo carmine was chosen as the target to be decomposed by the effect of active species and radicals generated between the electrodes. Air, oxygen, nitrogen and argon were used as discharge gases. Measurement of absorbance showed the decomposition of indigo carmine by microplasma treatment. Active species and radicals of oxygen origin so called ROS (reactive oxidative species) were considered to be the main factor in indigo carmine decomposition. The decomposition rate increased with the increase of the treatment time as shown by the spectrophotometer analysis. Discharge voltage also influenced the decomposition process.},

  abstract = { Oxidative stress is two sided: Whereas excessive oxidant challenge causes damage to biomolecules, maintenance of a physiological level of oxidant challenge, termed oxidative eustress, is essential for governing life processes through redox signaling. Recent interest has focused on the intricate ways by which redox signaling integrates these converse properties. Redox balance is maintained by prevention, interception, and repair, and concomitantly the regulatory potential of molecular thiol-driven master switches such as Nrf2/Keap1 or NF-ÎºB/IÎºB is used for system-wide oxidative stress response. Nonradical species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or singlet molecular oxygen, rather than free-radical species, perform major second messenger functions. Chemokine-controlled NADPH oxidases and metabolically controlled mitochondrial sources of H2O2 as well as glutathione- and thioredoxin-related pathways, with powerful enzymatic back-up systems, are responsible for fine-tuning physiological redox signaling. This makes for a rich research field spanning from biochemistry and cell biology into nutritional sciences, environmental medicine, and molecular knowledge-based redox medicine.

  abstract = {Chemistry models that include dozens of species and hundreds to thousands of reactions are common in low-temperature plasma physics. The rate constants used in such models are uncertain, because they are obtained from some combination of experiments and approximate theories. Since the predictions of these models are a function of the rate constants, these predictions must also be uncertain. However, systematic investigations of the influence of uncertain rate constants on model predictions are rare to non-existent. In this work we examine a particular chemistry model, for heliumâoxygen plasmas. This chemistry is of topical interest because of its relevance to biomedical applications of atmospheric pressure plasmas. We trace the primary sources for every rate constant in the model, and hence associate an error bar (or equivalently, an uncertainty) with each. We then use a Monte Carlo procedure to quantify the uncertainty in predicted plasma species densities caused by the uncertainty in the rate constants. Under the conditions investigated, the range of uncertainty in most species densities is a factor of two to five. However, the uncertainty can vary strongly for different species, over time, and with other plasma conditions. There are extreme (pathological) cases where the uncertainty is more than a factor of ten. One should therefore be cautious in drawing any conclusion from plasma chemistry modelling, without first ensuring that the conclusion in question survives an examination of the related uncertainty.},

  abstract = {The purpose of a plasma chemistry model is prediction of chemical species densities, including understanding the mechanisms by which such species are formed. These aims are compromised by an uncertain knowledge of the rate constants included in the model, which directly causes uncertainty in the model predictions. We recently showed that this predictive uncertainty can be largeâa factor of ten or more in some cases. There is probably no context in which a plasma chemistry model might be used where the existence of uncertainty on this scale could not be a matter of concern. A question that at once follows is: which rate constants cause such uncertainty? In the present paper we show how this question can be answered by applying a systematic screening procedureâthe so-called Morris methodâto identify sensitive rate constants. We investigate the topical example of the heliumâoxygen chemistry. Beginning with a model with almost four hundred reactions, and focussing on conditions relevant to biomedical applications, we show that only about fifty rate constants materially affect the model results, and as few as ten cause most of the uncertainty. This means that the model can be improved, and the uncertainty substantially reduced, by focussing attention on this tractably small set of critical rate constants. We discuss strategies that might be used to accomplish this refinement. The present results apply to a particular chemistry, but we suggest that possibly, and perhaps probably, investigations of other plasma chemistry models will arrive at similar results. In that case, an opportunity exists to systematically improve the quality of plasma chemistry modelling.},

Varying plasma operation modes were observed with increasing applied power for helium and helium/oxygen plasmas. The electrical and optical behaviour of the dielectric barrier discharge were determined from current/voltage, emission spectroscopy and time resolved light emission measurements. As applied power increased, multiple discharge events occurred, producing a uniform multi-peak pseudoglow discharge, resulting in an increase in the discharge gas temperature. The effects of different operating modes on coating oxidation and growth rates were examined by injecting hexamethyldisiloxane liquid precursor into the chamber under varying operating conditions. A quenching effect on the plasma was observed, causing a decrease in plasma input power and emission intensity. Siloxane coatings deposited in helium plasmas had a higher organic component and higher growth rates than those deposited in helium/oxygen plasmas.},

  abstract = { There is extensive experimental evidence that oxidative damage permanently occurs to lipids of cellular membranes, proteins, and DNA. In nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, 8-hydroxy-2â² -deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) or 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2â² -deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) is one of the predominant forms of free radical-induced oxidative lesions, and has therefore been widely used as a biomarker for oxidative stress and carcinogenesis. Studies showed that urinary 8-OHdG is a good biomarker for risk assessment of various cancers and degenerative diseases. The most widely used method of quantitative analysis is high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection (EC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and HPLC tandem mass spectrometry. In order to resolve the methodological problems encountered in measuring quantitatively 8-OHdG, the European Standards Committee for Oxidative DNA Damage was set up in 1997 to resolve the artifactual oxidation problems during the procedures of isolation and purification of oxidative DNA products. The biomarker 8-OHdG or 8-oxodG has been a pivotal marker for measuring the effect of endogenous oxidative damage to DNA and as a factor of initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis. The biomarker has been used to estimate the DNA damage in humans after exposure to cancer-causing agents, such as tobacco smoke, asbestos fibers, heavy metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In recent years, 8-OHdG has been used widely in many studies not only as a biomarker for the measurement of endogenous oxidative DNA damage but also as a risk factor for many diseases including cancer. },

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS, e.g. nitric oxide, NO) are well recognised for playing a dual role as both deleterious and beneficial species. \{ROS\} and \{RNS\} are normally generated by tightly regulated enzymes, such as \{NO\} synthase (NOS) and NAD(P)H oxidase isoforms, respectively. Overproduction of \{ROS\} (arising either from mitochondrial electron-transport chain or excessive stimulation of NAD(P)H) results in oxidative stress, a deleterious process that can be an important mediator of damage to cell structures, including lipids and membranes, proteins, and DNA. In contrast, beneficial effects of ROS/RNS (e.g. superoxide radical and nitric oxide) occur at low/moderate concentrations and involve physiological roles in cellular responses to noxia, as for example in defence against infectious agents, in the function of a number of cellular signalling pathways, and the induction of a mitogenic response. Ironically, various ROS-mediated actions in fact protect cells against ROS-induced oxidative stress and re-establish or maintain âredox balanceâ termed also âredox homeostasisâ. The âtwo-facedâ character of \{ROS\} is clearly substantiated. For example, a growing body of evidence shows that \{ROS\} within cells act as secondary messengers in intracellular signalling cascades which induce and maintain the oncogenic phenotype of cancer cells, however, \{ROS\} can also induce cellular senescence and apoptosis and can therefore function as anti-tumourigenic species. This review will describe the: (i) chemistry and biochemistry of ROS/RNS and sources of free radical generation; (ii) damage to DNA, to proteins, and to lipids by free radicals; (iii) role of antioxidants (e.g. glutathione) in the maintenance of cellular âredox homeostasisâ; (iv) overview of ROS-induced signaling pathways; (v) role of \{ROS\} in redox regulation of normal physiological functions, as well as (vi) role of \{ROS\} in pathophysiological implications of altered redox regulation (human diseases and ageing). Attention is focussed on the ROS/RNS-linked pathogenesis of cancer, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion injury, diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease), rheumatoid arthritis, and ageing. Topics of current debate are also reviewed such as the question whether excessive formation of free radicals is a primary cause or a downstream consequence of tissue injury. },

Much effort has been focused on wound care with an emphasis on new therapeutic approaches and the development of technologies for acute and chronic wound management. Wound healing involves multiple cell populations, the extracellular matrix and the action of soluble mediators such as growth factors and cytokines. Although the process of healing is continuous, it may be arbitrarily divided into four phases: (i) coagulation and haemostasis; (ii) inflammation; (iii) proliferation; and (iv) wound remodelling with scar tissue formation. The correct approach to wound management may effectively influence the clinical outcome. This review discusses wound classification, the physiology of the wound healing process and the methods used in wound management.},

  abstract = {Cold atmospheric pressure helium plasma jets are increasingly used in many processing applications, due to a distinct combination of their inherent plasma stability with excellent reaction chemistry often enhanced downstream. Despite their widespread usage, it remains largely unknown whether cold atmospheric plasma jets maintain similar characteristics from breakdown to arcing or whether they possess different operating modes. In addition to their known ability to produce a fast moving train of discrete luminous clusters along the jet length, commonly known as plasma bullets, this paper reports evidence of two additional modes of operation, namely a chaotic mode and a continuous mode in an atmospheric helium plasma jet. Through detailed electrical and optical characterization, it is shown that immediately following breakdown the plasma jet operates in a deterministic chaotic mode. With increasing input power, the discharge becomes periodic and the jet plasma is found to produce at least one strong plasma bullet every cycle of the applied voltage. Further increase in input power eventually leads to the continuous mode in which excited species are seen to remain within the inter-electrode space throughout the entire cycle of the applied voltage. Transition from the chaotic, through the bullet, to the continuous modes is abrupt and distinct, with each mode having a unique set of operating characteristics. For the bullet mode, direct evidence is presented to demonstrate that the evolution of the plasma jet involves a repeated sequence of generation, collapse and regeneration of the plasma head occurring at locations progressively towards the instantaneous cathode. These offer previously unavailable insight into plasma jet formation mechanisms and the potential of matching plasma jet modes to specific needs of a given processing application.},

  abstract = {Horse wounds have a high risk of becoming infected due to their environment. Infected wounds harbour diverse populations of microorganisms, however in some cases these microorganisms can be difficult to identify and fail to respond to antibiotic treatment, resulting in chronic non-healing wounds. In human wounds this has been attributed to the ability of bacteria to survive in a biofilm phenotypic state. Biofilms are known to delay wound healing, principally due to their recalcitrance towards antimicrobial therapies and components of the innate immune response. This study describes the presence of bacterial biofilms within equine wounds. Thirteen 8-mm diameter tissue samples were collected from (n = 18) chronic wounds. Following histological staining, samples were observed for evidence of biofilms. Fifty one wounds and control skin sites were sampled using sterile swabs. Control skin sites were on the uninjured side of the horse at the same anatomical location as the wound. The isolated bacteria were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. The biofilm forming potential of all the isolated bacteria was determined using a standard crystal violet microtitre plate assay. Stained tissue samples provided evidence of biofilms within 61.5% (8 out of 13) equine wounds. In total 340 bacterial isolates were identified from all the equine wound and skin samples. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecium were the most predominantly isolated bacterial species from equine wound and skin samples respectively. Staphylococcus was the most commonly isolated genus in both environments. Bacteria cultured from chronic and acute wounds showed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher biofilm forming potential than bacteria isolated from skin. This paper highlights preliminary evidence supporting the presence of biofilms and a high microbial diversity in equine chronic wounds. The presence of biofilms in equine wounds partly explains the reluctance of many lower limb wounds to heal. Non-healing limb wounds in horses are a well documented welfare and economic concern. This knowledge can be used to shape future treatments in order to increase the healing rate and decrease the costs and suffering associate with equine wounds. },

  abstract = {Oxygen free radicals have been demonstrated to be important mediators of postischemic reperfusion injury in a broad variety of tissues; however, the cellular source of free radical generation is still unknown. In this study, electron paramagnetic resonance measurements with the spin trap 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) demonstrate that bovine endothelial cells subjected to anoxia and reoxygenation become potent generators of superoxide and hydroxyl free radicals. A prominent DMPO-OH signal aN = aH = 14.9 G is observed on reoxygenation after 45 min of anoxic incubation. Quantitative measurements of this free radical generation and the time course of radical generation are performed. Both superoxide dismutase and catalase totally abolish this radical signal, suggesting that O2 is sequentially reduced from O2-. to H2O2 to OH.. Addition of ethanol resulted in trapping of the ethoxy radical, further confirming the generation of OH.. Endothelial radical generation was shown to cause cell death, as evidenced by trypan blue uptake. Radical generation was partially inhibited and partially scavenged by the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol. Marked inhibition of radical generation was observed with the potent xanthine oxidase inhibitor oxypurinol. These studies demonstrate that endothelial cells subjected to anoxia and reoxygenation, conditions observed in ischemic and reperfused tissues, generate a burst of superoxide-derived hydroxyl free radicals that in turn cause cell injury and cell death. Most of this free radical generation appears to be from the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Thus, endothelial cell free radical generation may be a central mechanism of cellular injury in postischemic tissues.},
